# What is hEdge?

hEdge is a complete IoT Platform built on top of edgex foundry leveraging its SDK that adds to its functionality so it is a self-sufficient IoT platform. 
One of the many functions that it adds is the machine learning capability that enables a non data-scientist persona to define ML model data configuration, train and deploy trained models to the edge. 
The deployed model then drives real-time prediction as well as event/alert generation at the edge. The platform also adds a concept of enriching machine data with 
context data so it can be leveraged for observability, ML or rule execution.
