# Contents

This directory contains the contents under respective directories
So rules contains rule definition of samples ( out of nox), but you can put other rules as well
Similarly, grafana directory containers hedge datasource definitions and out of box dashboards
While node-red directory has few sample workflows to get started on remediation workflows using hedge.

These directories are part of hedge-admin as part of docker build of hedge-admin
grafana gets the contents due to directory mapping while rules and node-red workflows are imported using rest apis by hedge-admin during startup
